A collection of gists demonstrating various benefits that factory functions can provide as a primary API entry point.

**[Configuration Patterns](https://gist.github.com/patrickkunka/893f9d4ba8180fa19ff9994f521d0d73)**

A collection of gists demonstrating how we can use configuration objects to validate consumer-provided input, and provide consumers with helpful error messages.

**[Facade Patterns](https://gist.github.com/patrickkunka/2019d6fe45abf9d5c5f8e764d05539d3)**

A collection of gists demonstrating how we can use facades to export lean, useable public APIs, without sacrificing established OOP coding patterns within our implementations.
